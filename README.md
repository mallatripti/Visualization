Visualization on MDG-7
 This repository contains the visualization of "Districtwise coverage of Water supply and Sanitaion" of year 2011 of Nepal.
 Here, I have visualised using d3js library. The steps to follow is as follows:
 1. In localhost, open the file named "index.php".
 2. From this page, you can see the visualisation further.
 3. There are 3 things included in this project: Bar Chart, Map, Comparision among 2 districts.
 4. If you click on Population, you will get the bar chart of Population Vs District. But if you just hover on the "Population", you can see that there are 5 other categories names as "Central, Western, Eastern...", then if you click on any of them, you can see the Bar Graph of the respective districts located in those Development Regions and same is the case for Sanitation and Water.
 5. Now, if you hover on "Maps", you can see 3 categories. When you click on any of them, you can see the map of Nepal and if you hover on the particular district, you will be able to see the respective value of the category that you have selected.
 6. For the "Compare" part, select any of the 3 categories, then select the districts you want to compare, then you can see the Bar Graph of the comparision.
 

P.S: This is my small attempt in Visualisation using d3js. Hope you like it.Thanks :)
